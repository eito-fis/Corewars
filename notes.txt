things to do:

coding
    corewars game backend matrix component UI
    build MGDB user verification component
    edit play routing
    confirm index routing
    react frontend for user & play
    [delete user feature? ]

    eamon questions:
    how to have 2 different components based on logged in or not (specifically for index)
    play and edit (whether or not to use same component but 'different inputs')
    should edit url include warrior index or id?

    WORRY ABOUT LEARNING

testing / debugging

    fix auth

    test api?

    One of the most widespread 'unsure functions' is being able to retreive a MGDB user based on their auth0 id

    Another widespread 'unsure function is this:
        const {_raw, _json, ...userProfile} = req.user
                .then(userProfile => res.json(userProfile))
                .catch(err => res.status(400).json('Error: ' + err))'
    userprofile may not actually be returned as a json... it's definetly returning the entire thing
    test authorization
    test update profile
    test mongoose connect
        update IP address blacklist
        (maybe use CORS)
    test create new profile with students

    after initial testing, retreive and include MGDB user specific information in state







Home page
    play button, create my profile, [basic match history]
